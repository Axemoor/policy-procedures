To recommend changes to this document, please use the "Fork" button in the upper right corner, then make your edits in your copy of the files. Make changes to main.txt, as the .pdf file is simply a formatted version of main.txt. Once you are satisfied with your changes, submit a pull request and the proposed changes can be discussed at the next populace meeting. If the populace agrees to accept the changes, a repository controller will accept them and generate a new .pdf.

The documents you see in the /master repository are the current approved documents. There may be proposed changes waiting approval. Those proposed documents may be found by changing the repository to /dev. Please check the documents in /dev before you submit an Issue. Checking before you fork and submit a pull request might save you some time.
